# nQueens_ANSI_cmdGUI

The N-Queens problem is a puzzle in which the task is to place n queens on an n-by-n chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other.

## User Inputs
The user should input an integer greater than 3, which will be used as the size of the chessboard and the number of queens on the board. The program has been designed with a makefile, so the user can simply navigate to the program's directory and enter the command "make run" on the command line. This will compile and run the program.

## User Outputs
The program outputs the positions of the queens on the chessboard such that no two queens are attacking each other.
